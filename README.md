My project is called Spool. Its going to be  like  a cross between stack overflow and tumbler. 
The point of it is to create a feed full of user ideas for projects or functions. 
then other users can add additional lines of codes called threads that get added to the spool.
 The end goal is to 'sew' together a working program or function that is 100% crowd sourced.

(user Stories)
Users will enjoy using this web app for professional development and for fun.
 if a user is stuck on a profession problem, 
 they can create a spool with the defined intent and a starter code opionally 
 and and open sourse community will be able to collaberate to help them 
 throught the problem. Conversly the user will be aable to add threads to
  other spools to help them and contribute to a culture of open source knowlage and learning.
   There can alos be just for fun projects. There will be no community standards of as yet but 
   the original poster of the spool will have the ability to delete other treads inn the event
    they are not useful or negative.
